# Ideas for FY22 - Offsite

1. Hospital Readmission (HRRP)

****

## Preliminary Report


**A. Initial observations based on exploratory data analysis (EDA) for FY21**
+ Overall, rate of readmissions is trending down with increasing number of discharges
+ With lower number of discharges, there is a greater incidence of excess rate of readmissions (area shaded red)
+ With higher number of discharges, there is a greater incidence of lower rates of readmissions (area shaded green) 

**B. Statistics**
+ In hospitals/facilities with number of discharges < 100, mean excess readmission rate is 1.023 and 68% have excess readmission rate greater than 1 
+ In hospitals/facilities with number of discharges > 1000, mean excess readmission rate is 0.978 and 45% have excess readmission rate greater than 1 

**C. Conclusions**
+ There is a significant correlation between hospital capacity (number of discharges) and readmission rates. 
+ Smaller hospitals/facilities may be lacking necessary resources to ensure quality care and prevent complications that lead to readmissions.

**D. Regulatory policy recommendations**
+ Hospitals/facilties with small capacity (< 300) should be required to demonstrate upgraded resource allocation for quality care to continue operation.
+ Directives and incentives should be provided for consolidation of hospitals and facilities to have a smaller number of them with higher capacity and number of discharges.
